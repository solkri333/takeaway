            <h2>Sex Toy Safety</h2>
            <p>It's crucial to ensure the safe use of sex toys to protect yourself and others. Below are some important safety tips to follow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="important">If using with a partner, always clean the sex toy before sharing to prevent the spread of STIs. Using a condom on the toy can also help.</li>
                <li class="important">When using toys in the anus, be sure to use plenty of lubricant. Also, ensure that toys have a wide base to avoid them getting stuck.</li>
                <li>Use water-based lubricant, especially with silicone toys, as silicone-based lube can damage them.</li>
                <li>Be cautious with porous materials like jelly rubber, PVC, or TPR, as they absorb germs more easily. Always clean or use a condom on such toys.</li>
                <li>Be sure to sanitize your toys before and after each use. Clean them according to instructions, but generally, a mild soap wash is recommended.</li>
