        <h1>The 15+ BEST Anime Waifus Of The Year Who Deserve Credit (2024)</h1>
        
        <div class="waifu">
            <h2>1. Juiz (Undead Unluck)</h2>
            <p>Juiz is the mysterious swordswoman from Undead Unluck. Usually wears a mask, but when her face is revealed, so is her “badassery” which is on par with Erza Scarlet from Fairy Tail. Though Juiz has even more grace.</p>
            <p>Her ability being related to “justice” is a perfect match for her personality but in a more mature, realistic and respectable fashion. Rather than the childish sense of justice that can be displayed in various anime.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="waifu">
            <h2>2. Akane (Oshi No Ko)</h2>
            <p>Akane shined in Oshi No Ko’s season 2. In fact, she shined in such a way that it was surprising to see it all play out.</p>
            <p>In season 1 when she shows her face, she seems creepy, Yandere-ish, and also exceptional. But she goes beyond this in season 2 and becomes a character in her own right that deserves not just praise, but “waifu” status.</p>
            <p>Her feelings were more on display, and winning the affection of the so-called “cold” Aqua was a sight to see that made her one of the best waifus of 2024.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="waifu">
            <h2>3. Ochako Uraraka (My Hero Academia)</h2>
            <p>Ochako Uraraka has been dying for a conversation with Toga Himiko since season 6, and she got what she wanted. This was displayed in one of the best scenes of the entire season of S7.</p>
            <p>While she was put on the back burner after season 2 or 3, Ochako shined again and reminded fans why she was likeable from the very first season of My Hero Academia!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="waifu">
            <h2>4. Ayase Momo (Dandadan)</h2>
            <p>Ayase Momo is the main female protagonist of Dandadan. This anime is similar to D Gray Man, Jujutsu Kaisen, Mieruko Chan, and Dark Gathering.</p>
            <p>She gains powers of telekinesis and is able to move hands similar to the “Invisible” hand seen in Re:Zero. Her love interest, Okarun, is the standard Otaku type of guy who LOVES sci-fi, aliens, and similar concepts.</p>
            <p>Momo’s character development, wholesome relationships, and on-screen drama make her one of the more entertaining characters of 2024, especially in the female department.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="waifu">
            <h2>5. Misao (Rurouni Kenshin 2024)</h2>
            <p>Misao is of course from the original Rurouni Kenshin. But in the 2024 version, she looks more polished and the animations have improved drastically, especially between her interactions and comedic scenes.</p>
            <p>She’s strong-hearted, passionate, hardworking, but most of all has her heart and morals in the right place.</p>
            <p>She may be a supporting role, but in the context of 2024, she deserves a mention.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="anime-waifus">
    <article class="waifu">
        <h2>6. Goddess Hestia (Danmachi)</h2>
        <p>Goddess Hestia, especially during this NEW season of Danmachi, has proven yet again why she is one of the stars of the show. And why she is considered one of the main waifus of Danmachi.</p>
        <p>She may not be the most witty character, but she has heart and can sometimes be surprising with her actions and intuition.</p>
        <p>She’s more than just eye candy when all is said and done.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="waifu">
        <h2>7. Marcille (Dungeon Meshi)</h2>
        <p>Marcille, to me, is the reason Dungeon Meshi is so entertaining, funny as F, and comical all the way through. She brings a sense of normalcy to a cast of characters who don’t seem right in the head so to speak.</p>
        <p>She also does play a role that is needed in the anime not necessarily as an elf, but as a mage.</p>
        <p>Some people can relate to Marcille’s reactions very well.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="waifu">
        <h2>8. Emilia (Re:Zero)</h2>
        <p>Emilia goes without saying. She has always been the waifu of Re:Zero, even during the waifu wars between her and REM many years back.</p>
        <p>Ever since REM has been asleep, Emilia has gotten more attention and has naturally become more likeable to those who were on the fence as fans.</p>
        <p>In this new season, her fight against Sirius was proof of her abilities yet again, and she continues to shine every step of the way.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="waifu">
        <h2>9. Ruby Hoshino (Oshi No Ko)</h2>
        <p>Ruby Hoshino has always been the “light” of the Oshi No Ko series. Bubbly, cheery, optimistic, cute, and driven. Sometimes she complains but it’s more in a “Innocence” kind of way rather than someone who is genuinely a pessimist.</p>
        <p>But we got to see some “darker” sides of Ruby Hoshino in 2024 that add to her character, peeling off some new layers to make her overall standing in the anime even more interesting.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="waifu">
        <h2>10. Erza Scarlet (Fairy Tail 100 Year Quest)</h2>
        <p>Erza Scarlet in Fairy Tail 100 Year Quest, a lot like other characters, has become more open with their feelings for those they’ve loved since the original Fairy Tail series.</p>
        <p>For her, it’s Jellal Fernandes.</p>
        <p>Seeing this side of Erza, even though it wasn’t full on, was a nice touch that J.C. Staff did a good job of portraying.</p>
        <p>And of course, Erza has yet again shown the world why she is one of the most powerful around and why she’s one of the greatest female anime characters of all time.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="waifu">
        <h2>11. Lucy Heartfilia (Fairy Tail 100 Year Quest)</h2>
        <p>Lucy Heartfilia is naturally gonna be mentioned in this sort of list considering 100 Year Quest is still airing in 2024.</p>
        <p>Lucy seems to have stepped up her strength, powers, abilities, and ingenuity in fights compared even to the last Fairy Tail series.</p>
        <p>And of course, with the personality and characteristics that Lucy possesses, it’s only natural why she’d be included in this kind of list.</p>
        <p>She’s consistently one of the favourite characters of so many in the anime industry (gorgeous looks aside).</p>
