        <h1>BEST Tentacle Hentai Shows You Won’t Forget (NSFW)</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p class="intro">When Hentai was first created, there is no doubt that Hentai shows started with an interest in unrealistic sex scenes—dubbed as the unanswered sexual desires and wildest wet dream fantasies of cultured men.</p>
        <p>One of which is Tentacles on a Hentai. And this list of Tentacle Hentai Shows To Watch will help you understand and have a great scope of what to expect on every Hentai title that involves wiggling tentacles.</p>

        <p>I assure you that every title is fact-checked to contain involvements of Tentacles. No more wrong tagging at last!</p>
        <p>Let’s spread this list long and wide and start dissecting all of these Hentai shows.</p>

        <h2>1. Tentacle and Witches</h2>
        <p>What’s a more excellent way to start this list but with a Tentacle Hentai show that screams it obviously with its title?</p>
        <p>The characters’ design lacks originality, with just a few touch-ups and tweaks to make them look unique. But they still look pretty generic IMO.</p>
        <p>The points for this Hentai come from its fluid animation, exciting story build-up, and great sex scenes. It has a unique blend of creativity for the story and sex scenes. Making them fuse and blend well to increase your arousal as the viewer.</p>

        <h2>2. Demon Busters Ecchi na Ecchi na Demon Taiji</h2>
        <p>Are you looking for a Tentacle Hentai title just for an excellent fap session and prepared to ignore the story plot entirely? Seek no further, as I have one of the best for you.</p>
        <p>Don’t let other people fool you, rating this as a garbage Hentai.</p>
        <p>If you look solely at its story, well, this one really sucks on that! But for the sex scenes with very arousing animation and sexual positions? This will be a hidden gem for that.</p>

        <h2>3. Aisei Tenshi Love Mary: Akusei Jutai</h2>
        <p>Another underrated Tentacle Hentai but flooding with great reviews and feedback. Kinda ironic, huh?</p>
        <p>Aisei Tenshi Love Mary: Akusei Jutai has a very straightforward and plain story plot. But that is very acceptable because this is a Hentai. It serves its purpose, gratifying, and is worth rewatching again.</p>

        <h2>4. Gakuen Shinshoku: XX of the Dead</h2>
        <p>Gakuen Shinshoku: XX of the Dead took inspiration from the famous “Highschool of the Dead” Anime series. Even the visual novel of this Tentacle Hentai show is based on the HOTD series.</p>
        <p>Sadly, we all know that HOTD is very hard to beat in terms of creativity and storyline. And it is not a Hentai, while this one is indeed a Hentai.</p>

        <h2>5. Inyouchuu Shoku and Inyouchuu Etsu</h2>
        <p>Milky Animation produced both titles, but Inyouchuu Shoku stands superior to Inyouchuu Etsu.</p>
        <p>Inyouchuu Etsu still has a reasonably decent and above-average flawlessness in terms of animation and serves its purpose. Not just as best as what Inyouchuu Shoku can provide and be better on most Hentai aspects and categories.</p>

        <h2>6. Etsuraku no Tane</h2>
        <p>Etsuraku no Tane is a Tentacle Hentai that would surprise you because it doesn’t have any brutality included.</p>
        <p>It may look brutal, but nothing overbearing and disheartening.</p>
        <p>Most of the sex scenes also are consensual, which is very surprising for a Tentacle focused Hentai.</p>

        <h2>7. Inyouchuu</h2>
        <p>Inyouchuu comes in 6 instalments; each was embraced differently by viewers of the culture.</p>
        <p>What it shares commonly with all the six is the character which also serves as one of its strong points. They may look generic, but there’s a certain charm in how they’re all portrayed in this Tentacle Hentai that makes them look original.</p>

        <h2>8. Venus Blood: BRAVE</h2>
        <p>It may look old and classical kind of Hentai, but it is only the creators’ preferred art style for this Hentai. Specifically, this Tentacle Hentai finished airing in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
        <p>For an honest review, it is just ok. It is not above average but also not below average. It stays on the 50:50 line. In short, enjoyability will differ depending on who’s watching.</p>

        <h2>9. Pandra the Animation</h2>
        <p>Opinionated uncultured people said that it ruined the manga version? I will say firmly that it doesn’t.</p>
        <p>Tweaking the story from the manga makes it more interesting for a Hentai Anime adaptation. Think about a game having a patch.</p>

        <h2>10. Elf Hime Nina</h2>
        <p>Elf Hime Nina might have flaws being a Hentai, but it can still fulfil your thirst for Tentacle Hentai.</p>
        <p>From a perspective of this as a general Hentai? Yes, there are a lot of Hentai titles out there that are better.</p>

        <h2>11. Mashou no Nie 3</h2>
        <p>A Tentacle Hentai should come with a warning before watching. Be sure that you are prepared to watch hardcore sex scenes that are very detailed; you can almost feel it.</p>
        <p>Your cravings for medieval royalty being forced, humiliated, and disgraced in a very hardcore Hentai way will be fulfilled in this title up to the brim.</p>
