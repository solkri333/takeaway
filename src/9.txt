        <h1>11 Characters Who Always Make An Appearance in Hentai</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p class="intro">Just as there are types of hentai shows and hentai cliches, there are also types of hentai female characters who show up time and time again.</p>

        <p>Some of these female characters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fit a stereotype.</li>
            <li>Fit some type of cliche.</li>
            <li>Show up often or occasionally.</li>
            <li>Fit into the “likeable” types of cliches.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, these types of characters are popular, well-known, and common.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let’s talk about it.</p>

        <h2>1. Monster girls</h2>
        <p>Monster types of girls are a staple in the anime community these days and are appearing more and more in various shows regardless of the age it’s targeted towards.</p>
        <p>Hentai breaks all these barriers and with newer shows having more visually appealing aesthetics, it only adds to the types of monster girl characters and the “situation” they find themselves in.</p>

        <h2>2. Elf girls</h2>
        <p>Hentai is f*cked up just like any other adult entertainment (except it’s virtual so no one is being hurt). That aside, elf girls are a common sight in various hentai shows.</p>
        <p>Just like anime of sorts.</p>

        <h2>3. “Step Mom” characters</h2>
        <p>This isn’t something I could ever understand, but the role and trend of “stepmom” searches on adult sites, hentai included, as well as these deliberate types of shows is more common.</p>
        <p>It becomes even more common over time as well.</p>

        <h2>4. MILFS</h2>
        <p>The next step from “stepmom” is obviously MILF characters, which are popular in all forms of entertainment. It’s not just anime or Hentai, it’s regular adult content and beyond.</p>
        <p>Men will always like older women on some level, especially those who fit the MILF category, and it’s not something that will ever go away just because the term is relatively new.</p>

        <h2>5. Tsundere hentai characters</h2>
        <p>Tsundere’s in anime are common, and the same is true for Tsundere types of characters in hentai shows.</p>
        <p>Even if those Hentai shows are vanilla, or relatively wholesome, or “not as extreme” as other shows in the genre.</p>
        <p>The trope of a Tsundere never seems to get old and dusty.</p>

        <h2>6. The girl who’s cheating with the guy</h2>
        <p>Some call these types of shows “Cuckold”. And this type of content fits into this like a plug in a wall socket.</p>
        <p>Other times it’s just a matter of these types of hentai characters being cheating bastards and bitches, and that being the source of the show’s entertainment.</p>

        <h2>7. “Ara Ara” hentai character</h2>
        <p>Just like with the countless anime girls or women who love to say “Ara Ara”, or simply have this kind of attitude and personality, you have the same thing with many types of hentai characters.</p>
        <p>Some of these hentai characters can fit into the MILF type of character or the “stepmom” type of character. Or others as well but these ones are common because these types are always older women.</p>

        <h2>8. Hentai tentacle girl</h2>
        <p>This is the very thing that the world thinks when they picture and imagine what anime is supposed to be like.</p>
        <p>They think about tentacles.</p>
        <p>The irony is if they’re thinking about that, this tells you what kind of content they’re looking up on adult sites or else the stereotype couldn’t exist.</p>

        <h2>9. Hentai girl with overly-sized breasts</h2>
        <p>This is only a lightweight version of what you will actually see if you watched Hentai or are a person who watches it at all.</p>
        <p>In anime, I’d say they can exaggerate this element, but it’s not the most often thing you’ll see unless you watch certain genres. But with Hentai, well, this is a common thing because of the type of appeal Hentai has in general.</p>

        <h2>10. Vanilla girl</h2>
        <p>The vanilla series Amakano is one of many examples of Vanilla types of hentai characters. This is where the Hentai series in question is more wholesome, chilled, heartwarming, etc.</p>
        <p>You could think of it as the “Iyashikei” of Hentai.</p>

        <h2>11. Girls who never get pregnant</h2>
        <p>And then there’s the joke about hentai characters who never get pregnant, which apparently doesn’t apply to ALL hentai female characters. But it happens often that it’s shoved into memes on social media.</p>
        <p>Obviously, this isn’t to be taken seriously and is mostly a good laugh, but these types of hentai female characters are one of the most common a person is bound to come across watching this kind of content.</p>
