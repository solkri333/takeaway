            <li>
      <h2>8. Fella Hame Lips</h2>
      <p>Fella Hame Lips</p>
      <p>Imagine if living sex toys do exist. Well, this kind of situation is what this hentai anime is trying to portray.</p>
      <p>Ichiji Matarou is a college student who has been alone for a long time and always masturbates with “onahole.”</p>
      <p>At the time, the largest onahole company introduced a new onahole product, onahoko, also known as the 4th generation doll.</p>
      <p>Matarou worked hard and gathered enough money to purchase the new product.</p>
      <p>After successfully obtaining it, the cable was unexpectedly unplugged and an error occurred during the process of changing the personality system. Type fla 4545 awakens to greet him.</p>
      <p>This hentai anime was an adaptation of another adult manga by Fue.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>9. Dokidoki Little Ooyasan</h2>
      <p>Dokidoki Little Ooyasan</p>
      <p>Tanaka Daisuke started working and living alone after graduating from college. One day he saw an advertisement for a cheap, small, old, and not a good boarding house.</p>
      <p>Tanaka-San immediately moved from his old boarding house.</p>
      <p>What made him interested in the ad was that if he paid the boarding house money on time, he would be given special services from the boarding house.</p>
      <p>And that special service turned out to be served and satisfied with the boarding house mother who has a small body.</p>
      <p>Each episode comes with different stories. The thing I love the most is how the housemother seduces him in every way that’s possible.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>10. Youkoso! Sukebe Elf No Mori E</h2>
      <p>Youkoso Sukebe Elf no Mori e Title</p>
      <p>If there’s any best sentence to describe this hentai anime it must be “the place where all the horny elves gather”.</p>
      <p>Alfhelm is a female-only elf world where they live in the place of the sacred tree.</p>
      <p>The war between the elves and dark elves made the elf’s death toll increase, plus the power of the sacred tree weakened so that it could not bear any more children.</p>
      <p>The only way is to find a male human who can help the village restore the population of the elf race by filling their womb with a ton of sperm.</p>
      <p>Yuuichi accidentally teleported but not by truck-kun, and meets Zero who is an elf village chief.</p>
      <p>Zero took Yuuichi to Alfhelm to milk him hard to help the elf race.</p>
      <p>A good combination of isekai will make you forget if this is a hentai anime until suddenly a sex scene appears.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>11. Oneshota The Animation</h2>
      <p>Oneshota The Animation hentai</p>
      <p>This hentai anime is a reverse isekai where the fantastical creature comes into our world.</p>
      <p>The story tells us about a young boy, Mahiro, who gets a visitor from another world when he visits his grandpa’s house in the mountains.</p>
      <p>Those two babes who come to visit her are an elf named Aria and Lulu, a half-beast woman.</p>
      <p>They both take good care of Mahiro and teach him a lot of stuff.</p>
      <p>To be honest, I almost forget if this is a hentai since it looks like an ordinary slice of life anime.</p>
